# HPL on NDv4

## Notes:
- The HPL test is not to be used for offical benchmarking results. It uses a container and parameters that give good results but not optimal results
- To make new input files for larger than 16 VMs refer to https://github.com/ctierneynv/deepops/blob/master/workloads/burn-in/calculate_N.py
